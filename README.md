# Weather-forecasting
Big data tools efficiently process huge meteorological data sets, from different sources such as satellites, radar; uncover complex weather patterns and Forecast for longer durations etc.
In this Project, I addressed weather forecasting with Machine Learning and Big Data tools (PySpark) to show whether is possible to make valuable predictions of meteorological conditions only based on previously seen meteorological data and giving a set of weather measurements, to predict which meteorological condition should occur

For futher more details you can refer to the presentation slides (update later)
# Data set
The data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data) contains hourly weather measurements data of 36 cities, collected from 2012 to 2017. This 5 years of data result in approximately 45.000 measurements (for each city) of temperature, humidity, air pressure etc.
